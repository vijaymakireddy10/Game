# Game
This project implements a classic Snake Game using Python and Pygame, a popular library for game development.
**About**
This project was created to explore Python programming and game development concepts. It's a great starting point for understanding game mechanics, user interaction, and basic Python game programming.
Feel free to explore the code, modify it, and use it as a learning resource!

**Features**
Snake Movement: Control the snake's direction using the arrow keys.
Food Generation: Random placement of food on the grid for the snake to eat.
Score Tracking: Keep track of the score as the snake eats food.
Collision Detection: Handle collisions with the walls and itself, ending the game if the snake crashes.

**Install the required dependencies**:
Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed. You can install Pygame using pip also you need random module
**How to Play**
Use the arrow keys to control the snake.
Eat the food (red squares) to grow and increase your score.
Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body, which ends the game
